# Scanimal
A very simple tool to help simplify some of the testing 

Just so you know i am still a newbie in python language this code may have errors which will be resolved by your recommendations or i will do it also. 
For the code to work perfectly i would recommend not changing any files name as i have given static location in the code.
Please do not use this code/tool for any unethical purposes
